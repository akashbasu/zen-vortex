Zen Vortex by Akash Basu
Zen Vortex is a Zen like take on the classic hyper-casual game Rolly Vortex. It tries to marry easy gameplay, soothing color and simple mechanics to be a mass casual fidget game for all ages.

The game mechanics are simple. There is only movement on the lower half of the vortex and the player has simplified controls for it to be easy to pick up and play. The game is a deterministically generated infinite loop. The deterministic random nature of the game and its implementation is a key component in future work on it.
